# Pong-Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python's Turtle module. 

This project was created for educational purposes, focusing on learning Object-Oriented Programming concepts, particularly class inheritance. Feel free to explore the code and make any improvements or modifications as needed.

# Gameplay

In this game, there are two players, each controlling a paddle on either side of the screen. The players can move their paddles up and down using the arrow keys (up and down) or the keys 'w' and 's' on the keyboard.

The ball bounces off the top and bottom walls of the screen, as well as off each paddle if it hits them. If a player fails to hit the ball with their paddle, the opposing player gains a point. The speed of the ball increases slightly with each successful hit, but resets to its initial speed whenever a point is scored.

## Controls

- Player 1:
    - Move Up: Up Arrow Key
    - Move Down: Down Arrow Key
- Player 2:
    - Move Up: 'w' Key
    - Move Down: 's' Key
 
# Dependencies
This project relies on the Turtle module, which is used for all the graphical objects and interactions within the game.
